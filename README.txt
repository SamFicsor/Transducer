Instructions to compile and run:
    open two terminals in the directory that contains the triangle app and transducer.py
    FIRST, in terminal 1, enter "python3 transducer.py"
    NEXT, in terminal 2, enter ./triangle-app-v1.1

    Then you can interact with the triangle app! Look at the first terminal for information on
    what state you are currently in, what input is being read from the GUI, and what output is being sent

Testing process:
    First, we coded what we did for part 2, then from there we tested in each state what happened with each input.
    Through trial and error we added and removed transitions to match how the app works on the class website. Our
    original transducer had the input and output flipped, so we had to do some initial testing to figure that out.
    From there, continuous testing was used to make sure that each state added had the correct transitions.
